A Lightning Component to show capability of exposing the [DSHI Systems](https://www.dshisystems.com/) Triage Wizard inside Salesforce so that case/call center agents can assist clients with medical care.

THIS SOFTWARE IS COVERED BY [THIS DISCLAIMER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedges/Disclaimer/master/disclaimer.txt).

## Component Details
This is Aura Lightning Component that provides a wrapper of the [DSHI Systems](https://www.dshisystems.com/) Triage Wizard that can be used by case/call center workers to help triage correct medical care to clients. DSHI provides the wizard as a JavaScript library utilizing dynamic DOM manipulation to render their screens and also does real-time callouts to DSHI servers for data to drive the wizard as one progresses through their screens. Based on some Locker Service conflicts with the DSHI Javascript library, I took approach to wrap the component in an iframe and I also use some eventing between their JavaScript code and my Lightning component to do some dynamic height adjustment of the iframe. Key aspects of the component are:

  * Dynamic height adjust of the iframe based on the content rendered by DSHI Triage Wizard javascript logic
  * At end of wizard, the Lightning Component receives the disposition notes generated by the DSHI wizard and then create a Salesforce note record with those details
  
Here is video of the triage wizard in action that shows walking through the wizard and eventually generating a note record at end:
